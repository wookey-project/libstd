/**
** \brief The global poist-initialization configuration system call
**
** This function permit to reconfigure devices that permit dynamic reconfiguration at
** runtime, such as GPIOs or DMA controllers.
**
** There is two main configuration familly: GPIO configuration, that permit to interact with
** GPIOs, and DMA configuration, that permit to reset, reconfigure and reload DMA streams.
**
** For all devices, the declaration must be done in the init phase. This function does not
** permit post-init device declaration.
**
** ### GPIO configuration
**
**   - CFG_GPIO_SET
**
**     prototype: sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_SET, uint8_t gpioref, uint8_t value);
**
**     Set the value 'value' to the gpio specified by gpioref. gpioref respect the following:
**     gpioref = port << 4 + pin
**
**     The kernel will check that the GPIO has been previously registered and enabled by this task
**     otherwise it will return SYS_E_INVAL.
**
**   - CFG_GPIO_GET
**
**     prototype: sys_cfg(CFG_GPIO_GET, uint8_t gpioref, uint8_t *val);
**
**     Get back the value of gpioref into val. If the GPIO has been previously registered and
**     enabled by this task, the value is returned in val, otherwise it will return SYS_E_INVAL.
**
** ### DMA configuration
**
**   - CFG_DMA_RELOAD
**
**     prototype: sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RELOAD, int descriptor);
**
**     Start the DMA stream (rise the corresponding enable bit to 1) if the corresponding dma_t
**     structure previously registered in the kernel has been fullfilled.
**
**     This permit to reload the DMA when looping on DMA transfers without modifying the DMA
**     configuration. The dma_id value is the value given by the kernel at DMA declaration time
**     during the init phase in the id field of the dma_t structure. This is a value identifying
**     the DMA stream for the kernel, which permit to associate it to an existing, previously
**     registered dma_t structure.
**
**   - CFG_DMA_RECONF
**
**     prototype: sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_RECONF, dma_t*dma, dma_reconf_mask_t reconfmask, int descriptor);
**
**     Reconfigure some part of the DMA controller structure. Only the fields supported in the
**     reconfiguration mask can be reconfigured after the end of init.
**
**     If all the informations needed to start the DMA are set, this function enable the DMA
**     controller, otherwhise, the kernel wait for another call to CFG_DMA_RECONF. This permit
**     the userspace to configure any DMA streams in multiple times, the DMA being started only
**     when all the informations are correctly set.
**
**     Using this function is not required if all informations are set during the initialization
**     phase, when the DMA stream has been declared. In that case, only a call to CFG_DMA_RELOAD
**     is enough, after the end of init, to start the DMA.
**
**   - CFG_DMA_DISABLE
**
**     prototype: sys_cfg(CFG_DMA_DISABLE, int descriptor);
**
**     Disable the given DMA stream. This function temprarilly disable a DMA stream action
**     by deactivating the corresponding enable bit. This action is reversible using one
**     of CFG_DMA_RECONF or CFG_DMA_RELOAD actions.

** \brief task initialization function, to declare devices and finalize init step.
**
** ### Synopsis
**
** This syscall is used in order to:
**   - Declare devices
**
**   - Set initialization step as done and activate all devices
**
** Setting initialization step as done is a *requirement* in order to activate registered devices,
** and GPIOs, but also to communicate with other tasks. Otherwise, devices will stay deactivated
** (with no RCC clock entry configured) and the task will not be able to communicate with others
** using sys_ipc syscall (SYS_E_DENIED will be returned).
**
** ### Using sys_init
**
** sys_init supports four subtypes:
**
**   - INIT_DEVACCESS
**
**   prototype: sys_init(INIT_DEVACCESS, device_t*dev);
**
**   Register the devices specified by the device_t struct pointed by dev. The device_t struct is
**   described in kernel/exported/device.h.
**
**   A device have 0 up to 4 GPIOs, 0 up to 8 IRQ lines. for each configure dev->gpios[] and
**   dev->irqs[] accordingly, and set the number of gpios and irqs in dev->num_gpios and
**   dev->num_irqs.
**
**   A device should have a name, (const char[16]), for pretty-printing. The kernel will not
**   rename the device and its name will be an empty string.
**
**   After the usual user content sanitation, the kernel check multiple elements of the device_t
**   struct:
**      - each IRQ line must be free to use (not already registered by someone else) and using
**        a valid IRQ value (in a range allowed by the kenrel, you can't register the memory
**        fault handler)
**      - each GPIO must exist in the target SoC and be free to use (not already registered by
**        someone else
**      - the device must exist in the SoC, its base address and size should correspond to the SoC
**        device map and its bus to the corresponding SoC bus.
**      - the device must not be already registered by someone else
**      - you must not register more than MAX_DEVICES (in ARM Cortex-M MPU MAX_DEVICES is 2)
**      - the task must not have already finished its initialization step
**
**  For more information about how to set GPIO and IRQ content of the device, look at the See Also
**  section.
**  \sa device_t, dev_gpio_info_t, dev_irq_info_t
**
**  \include examples/syscalls/sys_init_devaccess.c
**
**   - INIT_DMA
**
**   prototype: sys_init(INIT_DMA, dma_t*dma, int *descriptor);
**
**  Configure a DMA stream. The handler is awoken by the DMA ontroller when
**  the memory copy is finished.
**
**  The userspace DMA driver has only access to the DMA stream CR register.
**  Other registers, and particulary address registers can't be acceded
**  directly to avoid any security risks by using DMA for incontrolled memory
**  copy.
**  The status register of the stream is not accessible but its value is
**  passed to the ISR as second argument by the kernel.
**
**  Like all other declared user ISR, the user function is then executed in user thread mode, within
**  the task context and with the task access rights. the user ISR has its own stack but has an access
**  to the task's globals and functions if needed. The ISR can't be preempted by another task but can
**  be preempted by physical interrupts, its behavior corresponding to a bottom-half handler.
**
**  \include examples/syscalls/sys_init_dma.c
**
**  For more information about how to configure DMA streams in userspace, look at the See Also
**  section.
**
**   \sa dma_t
**
**   - INIT_DMA_SHM
**
**   prototype: sys_init(INIT_DMA_SHM, dma_shm_t* dma_shm);
**
**  Configure a DMA shared memory with another task. This permit another task to initiate a DMA trasfer
**  from or toward the DMA SHM declared here. Such mechanism permit such structuration:
**    task B declare a DMA SHM in its slot, authorizing task A to initiate DMA toward it
**    task A which to receive data (in DMA) from a given device (e.g. USB HS)
**    task A can directly transfer it to task B. Task A still manage the source device and associated driver
**    when the transfer is finished,task A send an IPC to task B to inform it that the data are ready
**    task B can initiate another DMA transfer, for e.g. toward another device (CRYP, SDIO...)
**
**    A more efficient way is to use a pipeline between task A and task B, allowing parallel DMA transfers,
**    which is possible using the very same API
**
**  For more information about how to configure DMA streams in userspace, look at the See Also
**  section.
**
**   \sa dma_t dma_shm_t
**
**   - INIT_GETTASKID
**
**  prototype: sys_init(INIT_DEVACCESS, char*name, uint32_t*id);
**
**  Get back a given task identifier, using its name.
**
**  This is this only way to get back the identifier of a task you which to communicate with.
**  the name must be exactly the same as the other task's name.
**
**  If the other task is found, id is updated with the target task identifier. This identifier can be
**  used for IPCs. kernel identifier is always 0. You don't need to request kernel id. Requesting the
**  kernel identifier will always return SYS_E_INVAL.
**
**  If the name is not found, the kernel will return SYS_E_INVAL, otherwhise it will returns SYS_E_DONE
**  and id will be udpated.
**
**  this syscall is only allowed during the init phase. After calling sys_init(INIT_DONE, 0, 0), this
**  syscall will always return SYS_E_DENIED.
**
**  \include examples/syscalls/sys_init_gettaskid.c
**
**   - INIT_DONE
**
**   prototype: sys_init(INIT_DONE);
**
**  Finalize the initialization phase:
**   - No more sys_init() syscalls will be allowed
**
**   - IPCs targetting user tasks are now allowed
**
**   - All registered devices and dma streams are activated
**
**  It is possible not to use the sys_init(INIT_DONE) syscall, but the task will
**  have a highly restricted access to the system (no devices, no IPC other than
**  targetting the kernel, etc.).
