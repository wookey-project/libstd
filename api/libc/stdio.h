 * Although, the behavior of the functions for the supported flags chars
 * and lenght modifiers is conform to the standard.
 *
 * The following is supported:
 *
 * flag characters:
 *
 * '0'   the value should be zero-padded. This flag is allowed for any
 *       numerical value, including pointer (p).
 *       This flag *must* be followed by a numerical, decimal value specifying
 *       the size to which the value must be padded.
 *
 *  length modifier:
 *
 *  'l'      long int conversion
 *  'll'     long long int conversion
 *  'd','i'  integer signed value conversion
 *  'u'      unsigned integer value conversion
 *  'h'      short int conversion
 *  'hh'     unsigned char conversion
 *  'x'      hexadecimal value, mapped on a long integer conversion
 *  'o'      octal value, mapped on a long integer conversion
 *  'p'      pointer, word-sized unsigned integer, starting with 0x and padded
 *           with 0 up to word-length size
 *  'c'      character value conversion
 *  's'      string conversion
 *
 *  other flags characters and length modifiers are not supported,
 *  generating an immediate stop of the fmt parsing.
 *
 * Conforming (for the supported flags and length modifier and error return)
 * to:
 * POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C89, C99
